# Node.js and JavaScript Interview Questions

This document provides solutions to common Node.js and JavaScript interview questions, including creating an HTTP server, demonstrating variable types in mathematical operations, and implementing custom array methods.

---

## **Node.js Question**

### **Task**  
Write a simple Node.js HTTP server that listens on port 3000 and responds with a JSON object when accessed via an API call.

### **Description**  
- A Node.js HTTP server is created that listens on port 3000.
- The server responds with a JSON object containing a message, a timestamp, and a success flag when accessed via any request.

## **JavaScript Question 1**

### **Task**  
Create a mathematical operation using `let`, `var`, and `const` in JavaScript and print the results in the console.

### **Description**  
- Demonstrates the use of `const`, `let`, and `var` in mathematical operations.
- `const` is used for a fixed value that cannot be reassigned.
- `let` is used for a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.
- `var` is used for a function-scoped variable.
- The results of addition, multiplication, and subtraction are printed to the console, including recalculations after modifying a `let` variable.

## **JavaScript Question 2**

### **Task**  
Write a function to implement `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and `flatMap` using JavaScript.

### **Description**  
- Custom implementations of common array methods:
  - **Map**: Applies a transformation to each element of an array.
  - **Reduce**: Aggregates array elements into a single output using a reducer function.
  - **Filter**: Selects elements of an array based on a condition.
  - **FlatMap**: Combines mapping with flattening of nested arrays.
- The solutions mimic the behavior of the respective standard JavaScript methods, demonstrating how these methods work internally.

---

## **Usage**
- Use the Node.js example to illustrate the creation and response handling of a basic HTTP server.
- Use the JavaScript examples to showcase variable scope and array transformations, demonstrating understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts.
- These solutions are practical for interview preparation and highlight the ability to implement common tasks manually.
